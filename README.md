## Overview
The **Wildfire ROS Models Library** is a comprehensive Python package designed for simulating the Rate of Spread (ROS) of wildfires. Inspired by various ROS model publications, this library serves as a powerful tool for researchers and practitioners in the field of wildfire management and simulation. It facilitates the intercomparison of different ROS formulations, enhancing the understanding and effectiveness of wildfire behavior predictions.

## Features
- **Diverse ROS Models:** Implements multiple ROS models with references to their original publications.
- **Fuel Data Management:** Organized data and configurations for various fuel types, both model-specific and generic.
- **Case Studies:** Predefined scenarios demonstrating ROS models under different conditions and fuel types.
- **C++ Code Exporter:** Generate C++ code compatible with the ForeFire solver, enabling integration into larger wildfire simulation frameworks.
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Tools for performing and visualizing sensitivity analyses using Sobol methods.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Emulate ROS models with neural networks for enhanced performance and scalability.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Example scripts and plots for validating and comparing ROS models.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` package manager

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wildfireROS.git
   cd wildfireROS
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install the Package:**
   ```bash
   pip install --editable .
   ```

   The `--editable` flag allows you to make changes to the code without reinstalling the package.

## Usage

### Quick Start

After installation, you can use the ROS models in your Python scripts as follows:

```python
from wildfireROS.models import RothermelAndrews2018
from wildfireROS.runROS import run_model, plot_results

# Define model parameters
parameters = {
    'wind_speed': 10,  # in mph
    'slope_deg': 0,
    # Add other necessary parameters
}

# Run the model
results = run_model("RothermelAndrews2018", parameters, "wind_speed", range(0, 20, 0.1))

# Plot the results
plot_results(results, 'wind_speed', 'ROS_ftmin')
```

### Example

Refer to the `tests` directory for comprehensive examples and test scripts that demonstrate the application of various ROS models and sensitivity analyses.

```bash
cd tests
python test_models.py
```
