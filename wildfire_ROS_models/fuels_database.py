Fuel Model Tables data

Description:
This module contains values for parameters as of some databases such as :
- Scott, Joe H. and Robert E. Burgan. "Standard Fire Behavior Fuel Models: A Comprehensive Set for Use with Rothermel's Surface Fire Spread Model." USDA Forest Service. General Technical Report RMRS-GTR-153. 2005
- Andrews, Patricia L. 2018. The Rothermel surface fire spread model and associated developments: A comprehensive explanation. Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-371. Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station
- Balbi et. al. IJWF 2020 A convectiveâ€“radiative propagation model for wildland fires 10.1071/WF19103

data may be imported as csv files, here stored as variables. 
All variables are post-fixed with the units such as defined in the original paper, 
corresponding to the units shortname in model_set.py
    
convention for variable names such as in parameter keys
